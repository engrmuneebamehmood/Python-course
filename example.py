'''
In this program, we will take two numbers from users and calculate their sum
'''
a=int (input("enter value of first number:"))
print(f"The value of first number is : {a}")#format print methood

b=int(input("enter the value of second number:"))
print(f"The value of second number is: {b}")#concatenate print methood

c=a + b
print("Sum of a+b :" , int(c)) #simple print methood
